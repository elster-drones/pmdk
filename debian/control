Package: libpmem1
Architecture: amd64 arm64 ppc64el
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory low level support library
 libpmem provides low level persistent memory support.  In particular, support
 for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is
 provided.
 .
 This library is provided for software which tracks every store to pmem and
 needs to flush those changes to durability.  Most developers will find higher
 level libraries like libpmemobj to be much more convenient.

Package: libpmem1-debug
Architecture: amd64 arm64 ppc64el
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory low level support library — debug build
 libpmem provides low level persistent memory support.  In particular, support
 for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is
 provided.

Package: libpmempool1
Architecture: amd64 arm64 ppc64el
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libpmem1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory pool management support library
 libpmempool provides a set of utilities for management, diagnostics and repair
 of persistent memory pools.  A pool in this context means a pmemobj pool,
 independent of the underlying storage.  The libpmempool is for applications
 that need high reliability or built-in troubleshooting.  It may be useful for
 testing and debugging purposes also.

Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory management tools
 The main purpose of this package is to provide a user with a set of utilities
 for off-line analysis and manipulation of pools created by pmem libraries.
 .
 The utilities may be useful for troubleshooting by system administrators and
 for software developers who work on applications based on these libraries.  The
 latter may find these tools useful for testing and debugging purposes also.
